# Adding Security to Mosquitto
Open the Configuration file:
  sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
  
Remove or comment out the last line:
  include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d
  
Add the following lines. They will tell the broker, listening on port 1883, to prevent any communications from devices that do not have a valid username and password.
  allow_anonymous false
  password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile
  listener 1883

Add a user with the following command:
  sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwfile username
Where "username" is the desired name.
  
Testing Mosquitto installation with security:
In Command Window #1, subsribe to topic (Control Z to quit):
  mosquitto_sub -d -u username -P password -t testTopic
In Command Window #2, publish to topic:
  mosquitto_pub -d -u username -P password -t testTopic -m "Hello, World!"
Should see results in Command Window #1.
