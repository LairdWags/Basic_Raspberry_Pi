After setting up Raspberry Pi, creating a new user, granting that user sudo permissions,
it still was not able to edit the network using GUI.The error being returned was:

   Config Error Saving /etc/dhcpcd.conf the dhcpcd configuration file is not writable
   
The reason for this, the standard PI user was a member of additional groups that the
new user was not. To resolve, add the new user to the netdev group.

  sudo -i
  usermod -a -G netdev NewUserName
